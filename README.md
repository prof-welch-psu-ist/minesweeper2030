# CLI Minesweeper-2030

In this warm up programming assignment you will practice test driven development (using jUnit) in addition to object 
modeling and capturing the design of your program using UML class diagrams.

You will be implementing a basic CLI (Command Line Interface) minesweeper game.

## Step 1

Come up with a data structure to store the state of the game and print it to the console. In fact, consider making what follows the first test.

Create a 4x4 board and place mines in the first two places in third column.

Print the board to the console, representing an empty square with a dash `-` and a mine with a `*`. Your output sould look like the image shown.
